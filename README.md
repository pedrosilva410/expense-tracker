# expense-tracker
 This is an expense tracker app I built using React. It allows users to easily log and manage their expenses, providing a simple interface for tracking income, expenses, and budgets. I focused on creating a smooth, responsive experience with real-time updates, and incorporated features like expense categorization and data visualization.
