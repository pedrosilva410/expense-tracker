# expense-tracker
This is an expense tracker app I built using React. It allows users to easily log and manage their expenses, providing a simple interface for tracking income, expenses, and budgets. I focused on creating a smooth, responsive experience with real-time updates, and incorporated features like expense categorization and data visualization.

## features
- Add, edit, and delete expenses.
- View a list of all expenses.
- Display total expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, transport, entertainment).
- Filter expenses by date, category, or amount.
- Optionally, implement a user authentication system if you want persistent data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
